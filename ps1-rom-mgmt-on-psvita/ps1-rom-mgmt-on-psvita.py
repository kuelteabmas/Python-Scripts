Each PS1 ROM needs to be of format .PBP file due to the Adreanaline requirements

This script has a mission of:
- fetch the list of ROMs in your folder (US roms only for now)
- gets each ROM title's Title ID Type (NPUI) and Title ID Number (94244) and concatenate them (ie: NPUI94244) 
- create a new folder titled with the newly formed Title ID
- move said ROM into the newly created folder
- rename the PBP ROM file to EBOOT.PBP
